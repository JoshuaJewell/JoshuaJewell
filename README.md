### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**JoshuaJewell/JoshuaJewell** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

Imagine if I just used the default template provided by GitHub...

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on education
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open source project
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help using a fax machine
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about psychology...I don't know anything about it, but I'm sure it'll be an interesting conversation
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: <a href="mailto:enquiries@joshuajewell.dev">email</a>
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: It took 2 years of being on GitHub to still not have come up with a better README
